<p>
<b>PURPOSE:</b><br>
This is the sixth in a series of workshops which has
brought together researchers in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and in
Statistics to discuss problems of mutual interest. The exchange has
broadened research in both fields and has strongly encouraged
interdisciplinary work. Papers on all aspects of the interface between
AI &amp; Statistics are encouraged.<p>

<b>FORMAT:</b><br>
To encourage interaction and a broad exchange of ideas, the
presentations will be limited to about 20 discussion papers in single
session meetings over three days (Jan. 5-7). Focused poster
sessions will provide the means for presenting and discussing the
remaining research papers. Papers for poster sessions will be treated
equally with papers for presentation in publications.<p>

Attendance at the workshop will *not* be limited.<p>

The three days of research presentations will be preceded by a day
of tutorials (Jan. 4).  These are intended to expose researchers
in each field to the methodology used in the other field.<p>

<b>LANGUAGE:</b><br>
The language will be English.<p>

<b>TOPICS OF INTEREST:</b>
<ul>
<li> automated data analysis and knowledge representation for statistics<br>
<li>  meta data and design of statistical data bases<br>
<li> statistical strategy<br>
<li> multivariate graphical models, belief networks<br>
<li> causality<br>
<li> cluster analysis and unsupervised learning<br>
<li> predictive modeling: classification and regression<br>
<li> interpretability in modeling<br>
<li> model uncertainty, multiple models<br>
<li> probability and search<br>
<li> knowledge discovery in databases<br>
<li> integrated man-machine modeling methods<br>
<li>  statistical methods in AI approaches to problems in
 vision, robotics, pattern recognition, software agents,
 planning, information retrieval, natural language processing, etc.
<li> AI methods applied to problems in statistics such as
statistical advisory systems, experimental design, 
exploratory data analysis, causal modeling, etc.<p>
</ul>

<br>
This list is not intended to define an exclusive list of topics
of interest. Authors are encouraged to submit papers on any topic
which falls within the intersection of AI and Statistics.<p>
